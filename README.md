Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, narrow or block, leading to heart attacks and other cardiovascular complications. The aim of this project is to develop a Bayesian network that models the key factors that affect the risk of developing coronary heart disease.
